<h2>The Piano</h2>
  <p>The piano is an acoustic string instrument invented in the 1700s. 
  Modern pianos have wire strings that make sounds when struck by hammers covered in felt.
  Different kinds of pianos include grand pianos (the biggest, most expensive pianos with horizantal strings, ranging in size from
  baby, medium, large, and concert), upright pianos (have vertical strings and are smaller in size with less resonance when played), 
  and digital pianos (an electronic keyboard alternative available from many brands). With few exceptions, pianos have 88 keys: 
  52 white keys and 36 shorter black keys shifted further up the keyboard.

  kinds of pianos!</a></p>
  
<h2>The Notes</h2>
  <p>As stated, the typical piano has 52 white keys and 36 black keys. However, there are really only 7 keys: C, D, E, F, G, A, B. 
  All the notes are simply different pitches of these basic 7 notes. After B, the cycle continues back to C (C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C, D, E...).
  The notes furthest to the left of the keyboard are lower in pitch, while the higher up you go, the higher the pitch gets. 
  The lowest note on the keyboard (leftmost note) is A. The highest note (rightmost note) is C. Note that these 7 notes are all white keys.
  The black keys are the "flat" and "sharp" keys: they make a note a half a step lower or higher, respectively, in pitch from their corresponding white key.

<h2>Middle C</h2>
  <p>Middle C is a big "landmark note" for pianists. First, it's important to figure out the octave on the piano. Octave are group of 8 notes: 
  C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C is an octave, and from that last C to the next C is another. There are 8 total C's on a piano. Middle C is the fouth C 
  left of the keyboard. Also notice on the piano at the notes come in groups. The black keys of the piano come in a pattern of across the whole keyboard, 
  alternating between groupings of three black keys and two black keys. To find C anywhere on the piano, find the grouping of two black keys and
  just play the white note below (right to the left of) the lowest black key!

<h2>Fingers</h2>
  <p>Proper fingering is essential for playing piano. Luckily, it's not too difficult to remember. For both hands, the fingers are numbered
  1-5 from thumb to pinky: 1 is thumb, 2 is index, 3 is middle, 4 is ring, and 5 is pinky. This gets more and more crucial as your playing
  gets more advanced.
