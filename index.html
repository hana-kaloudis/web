<h2>The Piano</h2>
  <p>The piano is an acoustic string instrument invented in the 1700s. 
  Modern pianos have wire strings that make sounds when struck by hammers covered in felt.
  Different kinds of pianos include grand pianos (the biggest, most expensive pianos with horizantal strings, ranging in size from
  baby, medium, large, and concert), upright pianos (have vertical strings and are smaller in size with less resonance when played), 
  and digital pianos (an electronic keyboard alternative available from many brands). With few exceptions, pianos have 88 keys: 
  52 white keys and 36 shorter black keys shifted further up the keyboard.</p>
